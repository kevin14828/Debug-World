**Hi**, this is Kevin
As the creator of this website, I personally think that this website is pretty beautiful, but I think what you should not expect is that the whole website was built in only one afternoon. The origin of all this is just that it is too boring. It's just a whim when maintaining on GitHub. As a developer, I can't guarantee how long it can be maintained. So please don't have too much hope for this website. I hope all visitors will remember that this is just a boring website made by a boring developer when he is bored.
